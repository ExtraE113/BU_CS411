#Ideas

- Music search
  - Some songs are only available on eg Apple music, Spotify, Soundcloud– unified search + player for multiple places
  - User story: As a person who subscribes to multiple music services, I want to listen to my songs without worrying about where they are licensed
- Media recommendation manager
  - Write down media someone recommended to you, and get a pretty library with metadata
  - Notes field, who recommended it field, etc
  - Load metadata, images, etc from library of books, movies, tv, etc
- Student link course search
  - Sucks to search for courses bc it doesn’t actually show you what’s being offered and not a good query language for hub credits
  - Depends on getting access to student link API
- Student link → iCal
  - As a BU student I don’t want to type in my classes by hand into my calendar, I want them to sync automatically.
  - Could also handle eg President’s Day holiday where tues is a monday schedule of classes
  - Depends on getting access to student link API
